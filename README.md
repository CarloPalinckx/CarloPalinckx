# Greetings stranger 🧙‍♂️

Won't you stay a while and listen? I go by the name of Carlo and hail from a small town called Etten-Leur in The Netherlands. I tinker on the world wide web by day and enjoy the realm of DX and tooling by night. Besides programming I enjoy building mechanical keyboards and cooking a hearthy meal.
